2. Copy the makefile, makefile.rules and opcodemix.cpp in the SimpleExamples folder.
3. Run a make for the SimpleExamples folder.
4. Cd to obj-intel64 directory.
5. Test by running command ../../../../pin -t opcodemix.so -- /bin/ls
6. The outputs will be present in files part_1 to part_6.
7. The sample outputs provided are for the /bin/ls.

IMPLEMENTATION:

PART 1: 

> do_ins_count() function gets inserted before every instruction.
> Instruction() function defines where the do_ins_count() is to be inserted.

PART 2:

> ImageLoad() and ImageUnload() are the two function that print the images loaded.

PART 3:

> Trace() is the instrumentation function and makes sure that every system call gets documented.
> DumpStats() prints the static and dynamic counts to the output file.

PART 4:
> Trace_call() instruments function before every function call. 
> The inserted function document the arguments and other information of the function call.

PART 5:

> Image_malloc() makes sure that our functions get inserted before every malloc/free.  
> MallocAfter() prints to the file what was returned after the malloc/free was requested.

PART 6:

> All system calls are assigned fixed decimal numbers upto 255. 
> Making use of these numbers to identify system calls such as read, write etc.
